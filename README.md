# bypassWAF

![alt text](image.png)

**bypassWAF** is a tool that includes two Python scripts designed to perform port scanning with Nmap, changing the IP address after every 10 ports scanned. The second script saves the scan results, categorizing the ports as open, closed, or filtered. This tool requires the Windscribe VPN client to be installed on your Linux system.

## Scripts

### 1. **vpn.py**: Scans ports and changes the IP address after every 10 ports.
### 2. **vpn2.py**: Scans ports, changes the IP address after every 10 ports, and saves the results as open, closed, or filtered ports.

## Requirements

1. Python 3.x
2. `nmap` (must be installed on the system)
3. Windscribe VPN (must be installed on Linux)

```


### 2. vpn2.py

This script performs the same port scan as `vpn.py` but also saves the results of open, closed, or filtered ports in an output file. You have to modify the file and change the IP.
